      <h1>Metadata

      </h1>
      <p>
        Metadata means data on data, information about data. A classic example is the old fashion card index you could see at libraries. Each book had a card with the metadata; the author, title, and where you could find the book. The card had all the info, except the actual stories or facts inside the book. 
      </p>  

      <p>
        You have probably heard that metadata can be collected by authorities, like the American National security agency, NSA. When your metadata is collected, it is just like the book. If you call a friend, the metadata will tell who you are calling, when you do it, and where from. The metadata won’t reveal what you and your friend are actually talking about, but the metadata can still be revealing. Especially when it is collected and put together with other metadata. 
      </p>

      <p> 
        Metadata is also used in webpages and is a part of SEO. Putting metadata into your code can help browsers and search engines to read and understand your site. One kind of metadata is the title of the site. 
      </p>

      <p>    
        The title of this page is <i>Lots of info about metadata</i>.
      </p>

      <p>  
        If, for example, Google understands what the site is about, it can generate a higher score, which means it will appear earlier in the google results. Yey!
